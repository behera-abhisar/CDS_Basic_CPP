# Experiment 1(A): Basic C++ Program - Hello World

## AIM
To write, compile, and execute a basic C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console, in order to understand the fundamental structure and syntax of a C++ program.

## TOOLS USED
- **Language**: C++
- **Compiler**: g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Platform**: Linux / Windows / macOS (any system with a C++ compiler)
- **Editor/IDE**: Visual Studio Code / Code::Blocks / Terminal-based editor

## THEORY
A C++ program typically begins with the inclusion of necessary header files, followed by the definition of the `main()` function which serves as the entry point for execution. In this experiment, we use the `iostream` header to handle output operations. The `cout` statement from the standard namespace is used to display text on the console. 

This experiment reinforces understanding of:
- The structure of a basic C++ program
- The importance of header files
- Standard output using `cout`
- Returning a value from the `main()` function

### ALGORITHM
1. Start
2. Include the necessary header file (`#include <iostream>`)
3. Define the `main()` function
4. Use the `cout` statement to print "Hello, World!" to the console
5. Return 0 to indicate successful execution
6. End

## CONCLUSION
The program was successfully compiled and executed, producing the output "Hello, World!" on the console. This experiment provided hands-on experience with the basic structure of a C++ program and the process of displaying output using the standard I/O library. It forms the foundation for writing more complex programs involving logic and computation.
